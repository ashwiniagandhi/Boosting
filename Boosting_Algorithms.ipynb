    "Boosting combines weak learner using base learners to form a strong rule.To find weak rule, we apply base learning (ML) algorithms with a different distribution. Each time base learning algorithm is applied, it generates a new weak prediction rule. This is an iterative process. After many iterations, the boosting algorithm combines these weak rules into a single strong prediction rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another question which might haunt you, ‘How do we choose different distribution for each round?’\n",
    "\n",
    "For choosing the right distribution, here are the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** The base learner takes all the distributions and assign equal weight or attention to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** If there is any prediction error caused by first base learning algorithm, then we pay higher attention to observations having prediction error. Then, we apply the next base learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Iterate Step 2 till the limit of base learning algorithm is reached or higher accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it combines the outputs from weak learner and creates  a strong learner which eventually improves the prediction power of the model. Boosting pays higher focus on examples which are mis-classiﬁed or have higher errors by preceding weak rules."
